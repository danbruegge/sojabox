    * show loading image if the text will be load
    * if browser will resize, change size of image and text an so
    * keep it simple
    * make code nice looking
    * think about on some tricks  to get a better handling for user, for
      example:
        * the user will view a text or an image, so he must only set one class
          to the object he wants to view and set a container with the full
          content
          # i think, this is the simplest way at the moment.
          # diview will set the divs to view it ina a lightbox
          # or is it simplier to lets set the user the divs?
