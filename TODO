    * create at first all functions to view images and galleries
    * image-gallary, same a a single image but with the use of rel="" in the
      <a> tag. That gruoped the images.
    * the close button should placed on top of the right side

    * think about load content in div
    * for content, use jquery load?
    * print function
[0.3]
    * zoom function...


NOTE:
    * the entire browserscreen is the imageviewer.
        * let it look like ristretto or an other normal OS imageviewer.
        * such as: the prev and next buttons are placed on the right and left
          side of the browser screen, no on the image. i think this is a better
          imageviewer expirience.
        * gallerie images placed on the bottom
