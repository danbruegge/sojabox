## TODO

    [0.2]
        * clean up the code, make the dev version more readable
        * set commits...
        * add some "fake" effects...
            * set the position of the empty image container, resize the hidden
              image and set the new position. Do the same by resizing an image.
        * using rel= in a tag is bad in html5 without the right attributes...i
          think defining a better solution is to work with the object
          initialisation...$('#some_id').sojabox(); <- all images children are
          in one group.
        * check IE compatibility
        * if window is resized, resize the image too.
    [0.3]
        * should sojabox show content, like a external website?!
        * print function
    [0.4]
        * zoom function...
